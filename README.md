# ‚ú® My First Wazuh Install & Agent Deployment Guide! ‚ú®

This is a super quick guide based on how I got my Wazuh server installed and connected my first agent. Let's dive in!

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Need (The Basics)

* A clean Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 or CentOS/RHEL 7/8/9 are good choices!)
* Internet access on that server.
* `sudo` or root access on the server.
* A bit of patience! üòä

## üöÄ Step 1: Installing the Wazuh Server (All-in-One Magic!)

This is the command that installs the main Wazuh components: the Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer (to store and search data), and the Wazuh dashboard (the pretty web interface).

1.  Log into your Linux server's terminal.
2.  Run this command:

    ```bash
    # This command downloads the Wazuh installation script for version 4.11
    # and then runs it with '-a' to install all components.
    curl -sO [https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/wazuh-install.sh](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.11/wazuh-install.sh) && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a
    ```

3.  **What happens next?** The script will download everything needed and set it up. This might take a little while, so maybe grab a quick coffee ‚òï.
4.  **IMPORTANT:** When it finishes, it will show you the default username (`admin`) and a **password** for the Wazuh dashboard. **COPY AND SAVE THIS PASSWORD SECURELY!** You'll need it to log in.

    *(**Note:** This installs Wazuh version 4.11. Always check the official Wazuh documentation for the absolute latest version and instructions if you need them!)*

## üíª Step 2: Deploying Your First Wazuh Agent

Okay, the server is running! Now we need to tell our other computers (like your workstation, or other servers) to send their logs and security info to Wazuh. We do this by installing the Wazuh agent on them.

1.  **Log into your Wazuh Dashboard:** Open a web browser and go to `https://<your-wazuh-server-ip>`. Log in with the `admin` username and the password you saved earlier.
2.  **Find the Agent Deployment:** Navigate to the main menu (usually top left), go to `Wazuh`, then `Agents`.
3.  **Deploy a New Agent:** Look for a button like `Deploy new agent`.
4.  **Follow the Steps:** The dashboard makes this super easy!
    * Select the Operating System (Windows, Linux, macOS) of the computer where you want to install the agent.
    * Enter the **IP address or hostname** of your Wazuh server (the one you just installed). This is crucial so the agent knows where to send data!
    * Assign the agent to a group (you can usually leave it as `default`).
5.  **Get the Command:** The dashboard will generate the *exact* installation command you need to run on your target computer (the "agent" machine).
6.  **Run the Command:**
    * **For Linux:** Copy the command provided (it will likely involve `WAZUH_MANAGER='<your_server_ip>'` and use `apt` or `yum/dnf`) and run it in the terminal on the Linux machine you want to monitor (usually needs `sudo`).
    * **For Windows:** Copy the command provided (it's usually a PowerShell command to download and run an `.msi` installer) and run it in an **Administrator PowerShell** prompt on the Windows machine.
    * **For macOS:** Copy the command and run it in the Terminal on the Mac.

7.  **Check the Dashboard:** After a minute or two, go back to the `Agents` section in your Wazuh dashboard. You should see your newly added agent appear! üéâ
